    <h3 id="section"><strong>Summary Of Born A Crime For Chapters 1 and 2</strong></h3>
    
    <article class="section">
        <p>Trevor Noah was born in 1984 in South Africa during the apartheid era when relationships and marriages  <br>between black and white people were illegal.His mother, Patricia, was a black Xhosa woman, and his father  <br>was a white Swiss expatriate.Noah's very existence was considered a crime under the apartheid laws. </p><br>
        <p>Noah describes how religion played a central role in his upbringing. His mother took the family to three <br>different churches every Sunday - an integrated megachurch, a white Afrikaner church, and an informal<br> outdoor black church. This reflected her desire to learn from all religious traditions just like in my country <br>religion is also considered as a powerful tool associated with women.</p><br>
        <p>Noah's birth was considered a crime, as his mother was black and his father was white. He recounts how <br>his parents had to hide their relationship and how his mother risked her life to give birth to him. Noah also <br>discusses the complexities of his mixed-race identity and how he navigated the racial divisions in South Africa <br>
            The book provides historical context about apartheid and how it impacted Noah's upbringing. He explains that <br> the atrocities of apartheid were not taught with an emotional or moral dimension in South African schools, and <br> his story aims to fill that gap in the colonial period.</p><br>
            <p>In conclusion, I find this story relates to the colonial period In Kenya where whites used to discriminate <br> against Africans because of their color by having their own schools, churches, and residences.
